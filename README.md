Requirements
-Python 3
-Termux on Android
-termux-api package installed:
     pkg install termux-api
-Place an alarm.mp3 file in the same folder as the script or you can add yours
and put it in the script.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup
1. Clone or copy the Python script to your Termux environment.
2. Make sure alarm.mp3 is in the same folder.
3. Run the script:
python alarmbot.py

üèÅ First Run:
You'll be asked to enter your name (only letters, 3‚Äì8 characters).
This name is saved in alarms.json.
Menu Options:
1 : add alarm
2 : remove alarm
